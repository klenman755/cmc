HKPA language:
    Methods do not have any return statement
    Anything following SAY keyword will be treated as string, and stored as Identifier until semicolon is read.
    INPUT keyword can only be used in new variable declaration. Only curtain values will be accepted
        if number => any integer
        if boo => "TRUE" or "FALSE" strings
    Declaration is only global: If, while or method "body" only accepts statements
        So no new local declarations are allowed. Methods may use arguments.

Semantics:
    Variable has to be declared before it can be initialized or assigned
    Variable has to be initialized before it is accessed
    Variables and functions are not allowed to have the same names
    Methods can access variables from lower or equal scope
    Method parameters of different methods can have same names, but parameters of the same method must have different names
    A name may be defined on different scope levels. Only the innermost definition is visible.
    The left hand side of the = operator must be a variable.
    The number of arguments in a function call must the same as the number of parameters in the function definition
    Multiplications and divisions are NOT superior to additions and subtractions, HAKP language takes mathematical methods and reads them from left to right.
    Operations cannot be performed on different types (number x = 100 +  True)
    Variable types are not interchangeable
    Variables with different types cannot be compared
    it is not possible to declare a method within a method
